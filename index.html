        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>Kaiser Permanente Summer Intern, June 2018 - August 2018</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Fielded phone calls answering any questions patients might have had, helped to remind patients about any appointments they've made</li>
          <li>Rapidly and efficiently prepared patient rooms ensuring a clean and safe environment before escorting patients in decreasing the wait time by over 30%</li>
          <li>Measured patient's blood pressure while making sure to inform them about any pertinent changes/answering any patient concerns</li>
          <li>Created and organized the distribution of patient pamphlets regarding some of the most commonly performed procedures in the neurology department that included information on what a specific procedure is, what will happen during the procedure, any short-term/long-term side effects of the procedure, and some commonly asked questions about the procedure which resulted in an approximate 20% increase in patient satisfaction </li>
          <li>Helped to organize and plan a Bring Your Child to Work Day Event in which members of the hospital could bring their children with them to work, my fellow interns and I operated various stalls filled with fun activities and gave tours to around 150 children around the hospital discussing all of the different departments and what kind of work is performed in each</li>
          <li>Completed a time efficiency project using Microsoft Excel to tabulate information on a spreadsheet on how long it took for all of the medical assistants to get patients in and out of their appointments including categories such as factors to take into consideration beforehand that would lead to an increase in time spent on dealing with patients, the time it took to get the patient to the room, general introductions, reviewing medications, charting vitals, and a final review prompt where my data revealed what categories took the longest amount of time which lead to an over 55% increase in time efficiency</li>
        </ul>
